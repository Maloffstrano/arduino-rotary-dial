# arduino-rotary-dial

This repo isn't ready yet. It's a work in progress as I take an AdaFruit
TrinketHIDCombo example project (a USB volume knob) and convert it into a
USB mouse that controls only a single dimension (either mouse X or mouse Y).

Why would the world want such a thing?

I built a M.A.M.E. cocktail cabinet a little while back and I need a rotary
dial to control the paddle for games that have a paddle. (A trackpad simply
doesn't cut it.) I could either buy such a device, or I could make my own out 
of a Digispark Tiny85. I chose the latter.
